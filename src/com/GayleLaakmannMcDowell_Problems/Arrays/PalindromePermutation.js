/*
Given a string, write a function to check if its permutation is a palindrome. A palindrome
is a word or phrase that is same forwards and backwards. A permutation is a rearrangement of
letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.

Example:
I/P: Tact Coa
O/P: true (permutations: "taco cat", "atco cta", etc.)
